## Thesis Statement

double $u$, control to $0$

## Main Contribution

Using switch state feedback to solve problems in 

$u_1 + u_2$, double controller

From an arbitrarily small domain to $0$

Since $\mu=	\frac{T_1}{T_1-t}$, switch before $t =T_1$ (otherwise $\mu$ is infinite), so add $t_s$ and $R$ (a level set)

## New Knowledge

prescribed time

finite time

level set

$sign()$ function

## Words and Phrases

ordinary differential equations 常微分方程

## Questions

## Good Sentences

The approach is based on $\cdots$.

$\cdots$, governed by $\cdots$, remains an active research area.
