# Prescribed-Time Stabilization of Controllable Planar Systems Using Switched State Feedback

10.16

## Thesis Statement

double control to $0$

## Main Contribution

Using switch state feedback to solve problems in 

$u_1 + u_2$, double controller

from an arbitrarily small domain to $0$

$\mu=	\frac{T_1}{T_1-t}$, switch before $t =T_1$ (otherwise $\mu$ is infinite), so add $t_s$ and $R$ (a level set)

## New Knowledge

Prescribed time

finite time

level set

$sign()$ function

## Questions

## Good Sentences

The approach is based on $\cdots$.

$\cdots$, governed by $\cdots$, remains an active research area.
